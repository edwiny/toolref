# Procreate usage notes



## Gestures

* 2 fingers: undo (hold for continuous undo)
* 3 fingers: redo (hold for continuous redo)
* 3 finger shake: clear canvas


## Colours

* Hold finger on screen to activate colour picker
* On colour wheel, double tap on black, white, or colour side to get perfect black, white, or shade of that colour
* Colour fill
   * drag color top right circle into shape
   * if there are holes, colour will bleed through to the whole canvas
   * if holes are only tiny, then you can adjust the color-drop threshold by leaving your finger or pen on the screen until blue line appears at top, left move left or right to adjust threshold (which will be saved)
   
ColorDrop can also change colors of existing filled shapes. 


Palette Tabs:

* Harmony
  * Can select between Complementary Analogous, Triadic, and Tetradic

## Shapes

* Hold pencil to create shape
* Gesture: hold with 1 finger to create a regular shape (ie. perfect circle or square)



## Conveniences

* When switching tools (pen, eraser, etc) click and hold on the tool to retain the brush used for the prev tool.





## Layer options

### Alpha lock

Transparent part of the layer will not be touched by new paint.

### Clipping mask

The coloured areas on the layer below will form a mask (or template) for the layer above.
So like Alpha lock, but in stead of using uncoloured areas as the mask, the coloured area on the layer below will form the mask.

One useful technique is to recolour an area of an image. Make the layer that contains the shape a clipping mask of a new, empty layer on top of it, then colour that new lyaer with the new colour you want the shape to be.



## Brushes


### Industrial - Rusted decay

Good for clouds

### Painting - Round brush

Good for thick lines

### Artistic - Old Beach

Adding powdered texture

## Transforms (arrow icon at top bar)

Move, resize or warp a selected shape.

Normally a tramsform is applied to shapes on only 1 layer. To apply to multiple layers, open layer menu, selet the top one, then swipe right on the layers below it and click on the "Create Group" option that pops up. Then click on the group in the layer list and apply transform.



## Selection (S shape icon in top left)


These tools select portions of your image.

Selections enable you to:
* apply transforms to the selected image
* constrain painting (also smudging and erasing) to the selected area (works across layers too, so you can select something on one layer, then erase that area in a top layer.


Modes:
* Automatic: just touch any discreet shape and the whole thing will be selected.



## Drawing Guides

Actons -> Canvas -> Edit Drawing Guides
* 2D
* Isometric -> for 3d drawings
* Perspective -> Adds perspective lines
* Symmetry
   * Enable assisted - this will cause procreate to mirror what you draw
   * you can enable symmetry in various planes
   * can enable/disable drawing assist on individual layers



## Animation

Actions -> Canvas -> Animation assist

To display two or more layers as one frame in the animation, go to layers, select the top one, swipe right on the layer below, then click on the Group option that pops up.

If there's a frame you want to always display, tap on it at the bottom of the screen and set as background.

To add a new frame as a copy from the last one, click on the frame at the bottom of Animation Assist and click Duplicate

If you want symmetry in your animation, click on the options at bottom and select Ping-pong - it will play the frames backwards when it reaches the end.

## Howto


### Copy and Paste

Selection, auto, click on shape, then select copy and paste at bottom. New shape will be created on newly created layer.

To move a section of the image to a new layer, first select, then cut, then paste (it will remove it from the original layer and auto add a new layer)


### use another image as guide

Actions -> Insert a file -> left swipe -> insert private photo (won't include meta data about inserted image)
